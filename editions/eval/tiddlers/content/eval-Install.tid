<<plugin-install eval>>

@@.note
''Important:'' The plugin ''tobibeer/eval'' is designed to be used with [[math.js|http://mathjs.org]], but does __not__ ship with it! You therefore need to install [[tobibeer/math.js|math.js]] as a separate plugin. Should you have [[mklauber/math.js]] installed, there's nothing for you to do since ''tobibeer/eval'''s library handling knows how load the ''math.js'' it ships with.
